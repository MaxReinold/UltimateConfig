# UltimateConfig
A highly advanced and console-based config for csgo.

Put the Main folder and the _Main.cfg(There's an underscore so it's easy to find and edit as it's at the beginning of the alphabet) in Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg

In your autoexec add "exec _Main"

Alternatively if you don't have an autoexec add this to your launch options:
+exec _Main
